# Project Context for Memory Store
# This file enriches background context for all memory recordings
# Loaded at session start and included in every memory background

PROJECT_NAME="mem-plugin"
PROJECT_FULL_NAME="Memory Store Plugin for Claude Code"
PROJECT_TYPE="Claude Code Plugin"
PROJECT_PURPOSE="Gives Claude persistent memory across sessions via autonomous tracking of file changes, git commits, sessions, and development patterns. Enables Claude to learn from corrections and remember project decisions."

# Architecture (v1.2.3)
ARCHITECTURE="Queue-based producer-consumer pattern"
ARCHITECTURE_DETAILS="Hooks (SessionStart/PreToolUse/SessionEnd) write JSONL entries to .memory-queue.jsonl file. memory-queue-processor skill reads queue on every message, invokes mcp__memory-store__record MCP tool to persist memories. Bypasses hook additionalContext visibility limitation."

# Key Components and Their Roles
COMPONENT_HOOKS="hooks/ - SessionStart initializes session, PreToolUse tracks file changes, SessionEnd summarizes session"
COMPONENT_SCRIPTS="scripts/ - queue-memory.sh (queue writer), track-changes.sh (file change detector), session-start.sh (session initializer), session-end.sh (session summarizer)"
COMPONENT_SKILLS="skills/ - memory-queue-processor (automatic queue consumer), memory-context-retrieval (proactive context loading), git-memory-tracker (manual commit analysis)"
COMPONENT_COMMANDS="commands/ - /memory-overview (project summary), /memory-status (tracking stats), /memory-recall (context retrieval)"

# Technology Stack
TECH_STACK="Bash shell scripts, Claude Code plugin API, Memory Store MCP server (https://beta.memory.store/mcp), JSONL queue files, OAuth 2.1 authentication"

# Current Version
VERSION="1.2.3"
VERSION_FOCUS="Queue-based architecture (fixed from broken signal-based v1.2.2 and broken MCP CLI v1.2.0-1.2.1)"
VERSION_FEATURES="MCP connection validation at session start, user transparency (reports what's saved), macOS sed compatibility fix"

# Known Issues
KNOWN_ISSUE_1="PostToolUse hooks don't fire (Claude Code limitation) - using manual git-memory-tracker skill instead"
KNOWN_ISSUE_2="Proactive skill activation unreliable (~20-30%) - queue persists items for eventual processing"
KNOWN_ISSUE_3="Background context too shallow (THIS ISSUE) - implementing rich project metadata"
